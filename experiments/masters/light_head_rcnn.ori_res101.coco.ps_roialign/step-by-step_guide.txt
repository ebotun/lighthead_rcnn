#Introdution:
- The parts used to build the computer are split into two: External and internal. 
A tip on each step will tell you if the part is external or internal
- Internal part: These parts ARE located on the motherboard.
- External part: These parts ARE NOT located on the motherboard. They lie around as individual parts.
- A green square will appear when something is detected, this is how you know you have found the correct part.
- Adjust the distance and camera angel in every step if nothing seems to be detected.
- Make sure that you get proper lighting.
- Try to use the detection on several parts and chose the one that gives the 
best results (when the green square appears the most).
- Make sure every item is in focus. Blurred items will not be detected.
- When you are sure the step is completed, continue to the next step.
- Make sure the component you are filming is filling the entire screen. Being too far away is bad.
- Put the camera closer to the cables when they are mentioned in the steps.
- Press 'space' to go to next step/continue.
- Press 'p' to go to the previous step.
- Press 'q' to close the Step-By-Step guide.

#Step 1: Info [Black]
Detection of the motherboard.
Only a few models are supported.
This item is large, flat and looks like a big card.
This is where all the 'internal parts' are placed.
Click 'space' to start scanning.

#Step 2: [1,2,3]
Scanning for: Motherboard...

Tips:
- Large flat item.
- Its shape is either a square or a rectangle.
- Get the whole motherboard in the shot.

#Step 3: Info [Black]
The next step is detection of RAM.
This is one of the 'external parts'.
RAM have a large width, but short height.
Often comes in quantities.

#Step 4: [17,18]
Scanning for: RAM (external part)...
Supported RAM for this motherboard:
Tips:
- Scan all sides of your external parts.
- Keep these in your hand or close by.
- Scan VERY close to correctly detect the version (DDR4 or DDR3). This is important.

#Step 5: [14]
Scanning for: RAM-slot (internal part)...

Tips:
- This is where the RAM from previous step will fit.

#Step 6: [Black]
Place the RAM (step 4) in the RAM-slot (step 5)...
Place the RAM into the RAM-slot firmly.
Try rotating the RAM if it doesn't fit.
Make sure the clips on each side is open before placing the RAM into the RAM-slot.
Close the clips/pull them up so the RAM cant fall out.
You can check if it's correctly fitted if you cannot remove the RAM by pulling it out when the clips are up.

#Step 7: Info [Black]
Find the CPU package.
The box has often these characteristics:
- a squared box.
- Intel: blue or black layout.
- Amd: black, red, orange, green or gray layout.
This step is about looking for information regarding your external part CPU to know if it fits your motherboard or not.
Try to get as much information about the CPU from the package before going any further.
Specifically check the CPU package for:
Generation/Support:
Socket type:

#Step 8: [21]
Scanning for: CPU (external part)...

Tips:
- This item is small and its shape is square. 
- Rotate and turn the CPU.
- Keep this item in your hand or close by. 

#Step 9: [5]
Scanning for: CPU-socket (internal part)...

Tips:
- This socket is where the CPU will be placed later.

#Step 10: Info [Black]
Open the socket so you can see that the CPU may fit inside.
The gray blank side should be facing up. 
Place the CPU inside the CPU-socket you just opened, but be careful.
When fitted correctly the CPU will fall into place and you can close the lock.
CAUTION: 
Placing the CPU inside the CPU-socket wrongly may cause damage to the CPU and CPU-socket.

#Step 11: [22]
Scanning for: CPU-fan (external part)...

Tips:
- It is often big, and has a fan attached to it.
- Keep this item close by.

#Step 12: [11]
Scanning for: Fan-slot (internal part)...

Tips:
- It is placed close to the CPU-socket (the area around it)

#Step 13: Info [Black]
Place the CPU-fan (step 11) in the Fan-slot (step 12).
Make sure the screws are pushed all the way down.
The CPU-fan should now be on top of the CPU.
The CPU-fan should not be moveable.

#Step 14: [12]
Scanning for: Fan power slot (internal part)...

Tips:
- These are often small rectangles on the motherboard.
- They have 3-4 metallic rods sticking up.
- Often white or black.
- Often close to the CPU/CPU-fan area.
- Might be needed to put the camera very close to the motherboard.
- Try removing the CPU-fan you just placed if you cannot find anything, as it should be next to it.

#Step 15: [23]
Scanning for: Fan power cable (external part)...

Tips:
- This cable is attached to the CPU-fan.
- The head of the cable is often white.
- NOTICE: This is a cable and needs to be filmed extremely close. Make sure the item is in focus.
- Keep this item in your hand or close by.

#Step 16: Info [Black]
Place the Fan power cable (step 15) in the Fan power slot (step 14) closest to the CPU.
Make sure the cable is pushed all the way down, and the cable does not block the CPU-fan.

#Step 17: [24]
Scanning for: PSU (external part)...

Tips:
- A large squared item.
- Often a fan inside of it.
- Often a lot of cables attached to it/hanging out of it.

#Step 18: [25,26]
Scanning for: 6 and 8 pin power connectors cables for the GPU (external part)...

Tips:
- These are attached to the PSU.
- There may be several identical cables.
- Keep these close by, they will be used in a later step.

#Step 19: [20]
Scanning for: GPU (external part)...

Tips:
- A large card.
- Often one or several fans on it.
- Keep it close by for the next steps.

#Step 20: [4]
Scanning for: PCI-E x16 (internal part)...

Tips:
- There is often several of these on the motherboard.
- The GPU is placed in these.

#Step 21: Info [Black]
Place the GPU (step 19) in the PCI-E x16 (step 20).
Make sure the GPU is locked in place.

#Step 22: [6,7]
Scanning for: 6 and 8 pin power slots placed on the GPU(external part)...

Tips:
- These are located on the GPU you just attached to the motherboard/PCI-E x16.
- The 6 and 8 pin power slots are on the top side of the GPU.
- Make note of these location of the slots.

#Step 23: Info [Black]
Put the 6 and 8 pin power connectors cables (step 18) in the slots from previous step (step 22).
If the cables does not fit, try another cable from the PSU that was detected instead.
Press 'p' to go back to previous steps if you forgot something.

#Step 24: [28]
Scanning for: 24 pin power connector cable (external part)...

Tips:
- Attached to the PSU.

- Often close to the CPU.

#Step 29: Info [Black]
Place the 8 pin CPU power connector cable (step 27) in the 8 pin CPU power slot (step 28).
Make sure the cable is attached properly.
If the cable does not fit, try other similar cables.

#Step 30: [29]

Tips:
- These are lose cables, they are not attached to any PSU or other items.
- These cables will be used in the next steps. Keep them close.

#Step 31: [10]
Scanning for: S-ATA slot (internal part)...

Tips:
- This is the slot where the S-ATA cable would fit.
- Often several S-ATA slots together.
- These slots may be on the sides.

#Step 32: Info [Black]
Put the S-ATA cable (step 30) in the S-ATA slot (step 31).
Make sure only one end of the cable is connected to the slot.

#Step 33: [15,16]
Scanning for: SSD/HDD (external part)...

- Similar to the S-ATA slot (step 31).

#Step 35: Info [Black]
Put the other side of the S-ATA cable (step 30) from step 32 in the SSD/HDD S-ATA input (step 34).
The S-ATA cable should be attached to a SSD/HDD and the motherboard.
